# File Management Tool for Missing File Detection and Copying

## Introduction
This report details the functionality and usage of a Python script designed to detect missing files from a specified destination directory compared to a source directory and to copy those missing files into a designated preview directory. The tool is particularly useful for ensuring that essential files are consistently available across different directories, aiding in data management and organization.

## Key Functionalities
The script performs the following key functions:
1. **Listing Files**: It scans the source directory and lists all files, including those in subdirectories.
2. **Finding Missing Files**: It compares the files in the source directory to those in the destination directory and identifies any files that are present in the source but absent in the destination.
3. **Copying Missing Files**: It copies the identified missing files from the source directory to the preview directory, renaming them for clarity.

## Detailed Functionality
1. **Listing Files in a Directory**:  
   The script utilizes the `os.walk` function to traverse the source directory recursively. It collects all file names and stores them in a list. This list serves as the foundation for comparing file availability between the source and destination directories.

2. **Finding Missing Files**:  
   By converting the lists of files from both the source and destination directories into sets, the script efficiently calculates the difference, revealing any files that are present in the source but not in the destination. This approach allows for quick identification of missing items.

3. **Copying Missing Files**:  
   For each missing file, the script constructs a new file name by prefixing `short_` to the original file name, ensuring that copied files in the preview directory are distinct. It then uses the `shutil.copy2` function to copy the missing files from the source to the preview directory.

## How to Use the Tool
1. **Run the Script**: Execute the script in a Python environment.
2. **Input Directory Paths**:
   - When prompted, enter the path for the source directory containing the original files.
   - Enter the path for the destination directory where files should be present.
   - Specify the preview directory where missing files will be copied.
3. **View Results**: The script will list all files that are in the source directory but not in the destination. It will also copy these files to the preview directory.

## Conclusion
This file management tool provides a straightforward solution for detecting and managing missing files across directories. By ensuring that important files are readily available, it enhances organization and data integrity.
